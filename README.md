## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

To build and deploy this project, ensure you have the following components:

- **ESP32 Development Board:**  
  Choose an ESP32 board with Classic Bluetooth support (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32). Most models work, except for certain ones like the ESP32-S2/C3 which lack dual-mode Bluetooth.

- **I2S DAC or I2S Amplifier:**  
  This module converts the digital I2S signal to an analog output. Options include:
  - *DAC + Amplifier Combination:*  
    **MAX98357A** I2S Class-D amplifier breakout, which is a compact and fully digital solution that directly drives a speaker.
  - *Standalone DAC:*  
    **PCM5102A** DAC module, which outputs a line-level analog signal to be used with an external amplifier.
  - *(Alternate)* Use the ESP32‚Äôs built-in DACs on GPIO25/GPIO26 with an analog amplifier for a simpler, albeit lower-quality, audio solution.

- **Speakers:**  
  Depending on your DAC/amplifier module:
  - With the MAX98357A, a single 4Œ© or 8Œ© speaker can be driven directly.
  - For a DAC like the PCM5102, use powered speakers or an amplifier circuit.

- **Power Supply:**  
  A reliable 5V Micro-USB cable for powering the ESP32 board. For portable operation, consider using an appropriate battery that meets voltage requirements.

- **Connecting Wires & Breadboard:**  
  Jumper wires for connecting the ESP32 to your DAC or amplifier, and a breadboard to facilitate testing and prototyping.

- *(Optional)* **LEDs or Buttons:**  
  Add visual indicators (like status LEDs) or control buttons to extend functionality (for instance, for manual play/pause or volume control).

## üîå Wiring Guide

Below is a recommended wiring diagram outlining the connection between the ESP32 and your DAC/amplifier module:

| **ESP32 GPIO**           | **I2S Signal**           | **DAC/Amplifier Pin**       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **GPIO27**               | BCLK (Bit Clock)         | **BCK** or **SCK**          |
| **GPIO26**               | LRCK (Word Select)       | **LRCK** or **WS**          |
| **GPIO25**               | DOUT (Data Out)          | **DIN** or **SD**           |
| **3.3V** (or 5V)         | Power Supply             | **VCC** (module power)      |
| **GND**                  | Ground                   | **GND**                     |
| *(If using internal DAC)*| Left Audio Out           | GPIO25 (DAC Out) to amplifier input |
| *(If using internal DAC)*| Right Audio Out          | GPIO26 (DAC Out) to amplifier input |

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Power Compatibility:**  
  Check the voltage requirements for your chosen DAC/amplifier. Some modules, like the PCM5102, can operate at 3.3V, while others may require 5V.
- **I2S Signal Clarity:**  
  Ensure secure, clean connections for the I2S signals to maintain a pure digital audio path.
- **Speaker Integration:**  
  For direct drive amplifiers (like MAX98357A), simply connect your speaker to the designated output. With line-level DACs, an additional amplifier circuit is necessary.

## üíª Software & Libraries

The software is implemented in **C** using the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF). The following key components are involved:

- **Bluetooth Stack (Bluedroid):**  
  Utilizes the built-in ESP-IDF Bluetooth stack to support the A2DP Sink and AVRCP Controller roles. This allows seamless audio reception and control commands between devices.

- **I2S Driver:**  
  Manages the digital audio stream using the ESP32‚Äôs I2S peripheral. The I2S driver is set up for stereo 16-bit audio at common sampling rates such as 44.1 kHz.

- **FreeRTOS:**  
  The real-time operating system underlying ESP-IDF that handles task scheduling, allowing concurrent management of Bluetooth events and I2S audio processing.

- **Native IDF APIs:**  
  No additional external libraries are necessary. All functionality is provided by the ESP-IDF, ensuring a streamlined development process.

**Development Environment:**
- Developed with **ESP-IDF v4.x and v5.x**.
- The project is configured for the **ESP32** target. (For ESP-IDF 4+, running `idf.py set-target esp32` initially is required.)
- Customize project settings using the `menuconfig` tool to modify device names, I2S pin assignments, and other parameters.
